# 👋 Hi, I'm Marek

I'm a Python DevOps Engineer with a unique blend of technical depth, business insight, and international experience. Currently working at a major European bank, I'm pivoting toward cloud security with a focus on **Microsoft Azure**, **Defensive Security**, and **Threat Detection Engineering**.

Before transitioning into tech, I spent over a decade in international business development, including roles at the Polish Embassy in Brazil and Refinitiv (World-Check). This rare combination of **KYC/AML compliance knowledge**, **software engineering**, and **cloud security expertise** allows me to approach problems holistically — bridging the gap between risk, infrastructure, and automation.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🎯 Preparing for **SC-200** and **AZ-500** certifications  
- 🧠 Building hands-on **Microsoft Sentinel** labs and threat detection projects  
- 📘 Writing a series of blog posts and walkthroughs on cloud security and XDR  
- 🛠️ Strengthening my expertise in **Linux**, **Bash**, **KQL**, and **Microsoft Defender** tools  
- 💼 Developing a robust career path toward **Azure Security Architect**

## 🧩 My Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, Bash, YAML, KQL, SQL
- **Cloud & Infra**: Azure, Linux, Docker  
- **Dev Tools**: Git, Markdown, JupyterLab, VS Code  
- **Languages spoken**: Polish, English, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Dutch (learning), French (learning)
