# 👋 Hi, I'm Marek

I'm a **Python DevOps Engineer** with a strong focus on backend development, automation, and clean system design.  
Right now, my main interests revolve around **Python**, **API development**, and **Azure infrastructure**, supported by solid security and reliability principles.

My background includes over a decade in international business development (Polish Embassy in Brazil, Refinitiv/World-Check), which gives me a rare mix of **engineering**, **business**, and **risk/compliance** intuition. I enjoy building solutions that make sense technically and operationally.

## 🔧 Current Projects

I’m building a portfolio of practical, real-world projects focused on backend engineering, APIs, and cloud fundamentals.

### Current Project: Event & Log Collector

A modular Flask-based backend following clean architecture principles

I’m currently building a lightweight event and log collection system designed with a clean, layered structure.
The focus is on creating a maintainable, testable backend and showcasing solid engineering fundamentals rather than building a production SIEM.

This project highlights:

- clear separation of responsibilities across domains, services, and infrastructure

- a scalable, modular project layout inspired by clean architecture

- a well-structured Flask API for event ingestion, querying, and simple analytics

- a thoughtful testing approach (services + API)

- Docker-based deployment, with future integration points for Azure

- essential security practices such as configuration management and API key handling

More features and documentation will be added as the project evolves.
