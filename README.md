# 👋 Hi, I'm Marek

I'm a **Python DevOps Engineer** with a strong focus on backend development, automation, and clean system design.  
Right now, my main interests revolve around **Python**, **API development**, and **Azure infrastructure**, supported by solid security and reliability principles.

My background includes over a decade in international business development (Polish Embassy in Brazil, Refinitiv/World-Check), which gives me a rare mix of **engineering**, **business**, and **risk/compliance** intuition. I enjoy building solutions that make sense technically and operationally.

## 🔧 Current Projects

I’m building a portfolio of practical, real-world projects focused on backend engineering, APIs, and cloud fundamentals.

### 📦 Upcoming Portfolio Project  
(inspired by Clean Architecture & microservice patterns)

A modular Python-based system, organized into well-defined layers and services, potentially with an API or lightweight service communication layer in the middle.  

This project will demonstrate:

- proper separation of concerns  
- scalable project structure  
- API handling  
- testing approach  
- CI/CD and deployment to Azure  
- practical security considerations  

More details coming as the project evolves.
